<p class='c012'>That toy of modern linguists—Volapûk—is
having a wonderful run with
publishers. Handbooks to it “now
tread on one another’s heels.” The
American Philosophical Society, at a
meeting last fall, appointed a committee
to examine into the scientific value
of this “universal language.” Their
report points out the requirements for
such a language, and finds on comparing
them with Father Schleyer’s system,
that it is “synthetic and complex,”
and therefore unsuited to modern
needs.</p>

<p class='c012'>M. Renan has a picturesque way of

and Ziglag adopt by and by the
ways of a saint. He will be the author
of the Psalms, the sacred choragus,
the type of the future Saviour.
Jesus will be a son of David. The pious
souls who will find delight in the
resignation and the melancholy contained
in the finest of liturgical books,
will think themselves in communion
with this bandit. Humanity will believe
in a final justice on the testimony
of David, who never thought of it, and
of the Sibyl, who never existed. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Teste

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='t64' class='c006'>TWO SHAKESPEARIAN CHARACTERS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Tragedy of Cymbeline was written
during the latter ten years of Shakespeare’s
life and has much of the
exquisite beauty and austere sweetness
of <cite>Othello</cite> and <cite>The Tempest</cite>, which belong
to the same period. In structure
this Tragedy is quite complex. There
are in it no less than four distinct
groups of persons, all of whom, however,
though without any concert or
common purpose, draw together with
perfect smoothness and harmony in
working out the author’s plan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of all the characters that acquit
themselves in this drama, no two show
such different dispositions as Imogen
and the Queen; for, wherever and under
whatever conditions they are found,
antagonism in character is sure to be
shown. The leading purpose of the
play is to be sought for in the character
of Imogen. She is an impersonation
of the moral beauty of womanhood.
This beauty is the vital current
of the whole delineation, and everything
about her, her form, her features
and expression, her dress, her walk,
her every motion are steeped in its
efficacy. This virtue radiates from her
on others and exercises a wonderful
influence on almost all about her. Already
a wife when we first see her, Imogen
acts but little in any other quality;
yet in this one she approves herself
mistress of that womanly perfection
which would make glad the heart and
perfect the character of every one who
stood in any relationship with her. To
make up a perfect woman, she possesses
sound judgment and decision of
character, which are most admirably
displayed in her choice of a husband.
Irrespective of parental desires and
the efficacy of royal blood, she wisely
preferred a true, though humble man
to a royal personage that could well be
regarded as a counterfeit of humanity.
Posthumus sprang of heroic stock.
Having been left an orphan at birth,
he was taken by the king and grew up
the foster-brother and playmate of the
princess; and their love, rooted in the
innocence of childhood, interlacing all
their childish thoughts and pleasures,
has ripened with their growth; and
now appears the settled habit of their
very souls. Cloten, whom she had
the good judgment to refuse, was well
described when Mr. Hudson phrased
him a “noble instance of a man or
thing, with not merely a loose screw
in the gearing but with all the screws
loose.” He was, therefore, the last
man that any body, of such sense and
refinement as Imogen possessed, could
ever be brought to endure. Her faithfulness
is seen in her bearing Cloten’s
persecutions with patience, till he begins
to abuse her exiled husband; then,
true to him who is a part of her very
nature, she quickly turns upon Cloten,
at the same time regretting that he
puts her to “forget a lady’s manners
by being so verbal.” That Imogen
was sincerely virtuous is proved by
the fact that Iachimo, upon approaching
her with evil intentions, was compelled
to exclaim, “Boldness, be my
friend! arm me, audacity, from head
to foot!” Truly appropriate was this
language, for having once learned his
wilful intention she with one word
shattered his armor of “audacity.” So
great was the influence of her purity
that Iachimo was at once charmed
and chastened, for “under the ribs
of death” her moral beauty had created
a soul. And further is the truth
of her virtue confirmed when Iachimo
discovers himself and speaks of her as
“that paragon for whom my heart
drops blood, and my false spirits quail
to remember.” That her moral delicacy
shrinks from the least atom of
untruth, is touchingly shown in this,
“If I lie, and do not harm by it,
though the gods hear, I hope they’ll
pardon it.” Imogen might don a man’s
attire, but her pure motives and God-given
virtues had shaped a heart that
could not contain the sterner qualities
of the other sex; and so utterly did
she fail in her attempt to appear as a
man, that we find wise and reverend
manhood exclaiming at sight of her,
“Behold divineness no elder than a
boy!”</p>

<p class='c012'>It might be with reluctance that we
would turn from contemplating a perfect
character to look at the faults of
an imperfect one, if we did not first
remember that the Queen possesses
only those commonplace elements of
character that characterizes, though in
a less degree, all moral beings. But,
since we are through natural instinct
and acquired inclination always ready
to blame poor human nature, we cannot
but give vent to our feelings when
we find so mean a grade as is possessed
by Cymbeline’s Queen. She is deeply
false, false to everything but her son
and her own ambition. She has the
king quite under her power, the lords
blame not the king for any wrong act,
knowing that he sees only through her
eyes, acts only as she plans, and speaks
only as she dictates. The Queen has
set her heart upon matching her son
with the princess, who is expected to
succeed her father in the kingdom, not
so much through love for the poor clod,
as that she knows him to be a clod
whom she will be able to control, and
thus secure the continuation of her
power. Perhaps the depth of her character
is not fathomed by all, and certainly
not by the king, until on her
death-bed she reveals the most detestible
qualities of a corrupt nature.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus it is seen that in these characters
we have simplicity and harmony
of character, clearness of understanding,
depth and purity of feeling, the
whole circle and aggregate of eloquent
womanhood contrasted with a character
inconsistent only with the truth,
vile deceit, a masculine disposition
combined with all that is complex, detestible
and fiendish, last, but most
prominent of all, a woman destitute of
womanhood.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some boys console themselves for
their want of energy in study by the
fact that Patrick Henry, for instance,
was a very poor student at school, or
that Byron, or some other illustrious
character was the poorest member of
his class at College. They have the
presumption to imagine that, because
they follow in school the example of
Henry and Byron, they will be as renowned
in after life as an inevitable sequence.
They dream of doing great
things bye and bye, but are very indifferent
about the present little things,
which are the essentials of greatness.
Such boys forget to compare what
Patrick Henry was, with what he might
have been, had he diligently applied
himself at school. Therefore it is no
wonder that in after life they realize
their mistake and exclaim farewell, a
long farewell to all my anticipated
greatness!</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c012'>That old bigot Berkley, governor of
the colony of Virginia, once said, “I
thank God that there are no free
schools, nor printing-presses, and I
hope we shall not have them these
hundred years!!” It was thought that
this sentiment had long ago been eradicated
from the minds of the American
people, especially of the higher
classes, but it is a sad fact that a few
weeks ago an expression of like import
was uttered even within the halls of
the United States Senate. Now, two
centuries after Berkley, a United States
Senator says that, were he called upon
to frame a title for the Blair Educational
Bill, he would call it an act to erect
a monument to Alexander Hamilton,
and to encourage mendicancy in the
South. Such a sentiment as this needs
no comment, for every man who is a
true patriot and has ever been outside
of his own county will condemn the
Senator’s remarks upon him who first
“smote the rock of national resources
and abundant streams of revenue gushed
forth, who touched the corpse of
public credit and it sprang upon its
feet.”</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c012'>The primary object of a collegiate
education should not be to educate for
the sole purpose of making money, but
to educate for education’s sake. The
statement can be made, without too
much self-laudation, that many Southern
boys give evidences of great original
ability while at college, but just as
soon as they complete the course, too
many think only of making money,
and therefore entirely neglect literary
work. Never can the South boast of a
golden age of literature, nor can she
furnish her own text-books, until this
mistaken idea of education is driven
out by the substitution of one which
will give us a higher standard of refinement,
and make us independent so
far as poetry, history, fiction and text-books are concerned.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c012'>People cannot do without news, and
therefore newspapers are necessary.
Furthermore, if their object be improvement
in literary attainments, they
exert an indispensable influence for
good. They unite the people more
closely, and have a great tendency to
prevent sectionalism. But in our modern
newspapers there is too much of
the sensational and of the worthless.
There is a continual contest between
some papers to see which one can give
the best account of the most brutal
murders. In addition to this, every
little thing, of no importance whatever,
must be noticed, and therefore it takes
up the space which should be occupied
by good solid reading. Zeb. Vance
can’t have a photograph taken, nor can
President Cleveland wear a plug hat
without its being mentioned in some
newspaper.</p>

<p class='c012'>Wake Forest has sustained a great
loss by the death of Prof. J. R. Duggan.
It is sad to see one so young and at
the same time so promising and so devoted
to his profession, taken from the
field of scientific investigation. The
President of his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">alma mater</span></i> said that
he never missed a college duty. This
is a compliment which indeed only a
very few boys ever win. Punctuality is
just as essential to success as a knowledge
of text-books. Had morning
prayers no other object than to get
boys to conform to systematic habits,
they could not be abolished without
detriment to the scholars. For the
boy who learns to be punctual at school
will be so in life.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c012'>Many young men who read of the
eccentricities and vices of men of genius
at once try to become eccentric by
practicing the same vices. Some who
have morbidly sensitive dispositions,
imagine that they are exactly like Edgar
Allan Poe, and determine to become
poets. They let their hair grow long,
assume a dreamy expression of face,
write poetry that is enough to exasperate
any man of sense, and because
every body does not go into ecstacy
over their literary performances, talk
about how inappreciative the world has
always been of the first efforts of genius.
These same young men will practice
the vices of Goldsmith, Byron, Poe, and
other great geniuses of the past, and
imagine that it is conclusive proof of
the fact that mentally they are like
these great men. Some are always trying
to say something witty in a brusque
way, because that was the way Dr.
Johnson did. Others imagine that
they can never become lawyers or
politicians unless they get drunk  occasionally.
They say that Sheridan,
Webster, Prentiss, and other great orators
drank freely.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c012'>It is a lamentable fact that a large
number of the young men of the present
day who intend to enter the ministry
seem to think it necessary to be able to
speak in a drawling, sanctimonious
tone, until this method of talking has
been denominated the “clerical whine.”
There is no reason why a preacher
should speak in the pulpit with an entirely
different voice from that which
he employs on other occasions. The
truth of it is, some young preachers
hear a man who has a big reputation as
a preacher speak with the nasal twang,
and straightway fancy that they can
never become good preachers unless
they can speak in the same way. Other
young preachers try to imitate Sam
Jones, or some other popular preacher,
especially their eccentricities. The
world makes allowances for the eccentricities
and vices of genius, but never
countenances them in mediocrity. The
young man who thus tries to <i>ape</i> other
men, not only loses the respect of
others, but soon loses his own self respect.
Individuality is a characteristic
of genius, so that a young man who
tries to imitate others proves by his actions
that he is devoid of real ability,
and makes himself contemptible in the
eyes of sensible people. Every young
man should determine to preserve his
identity, and have the stamp of individuality
upon all his actions, and he
will then at least command respect, if
he does not become distinguished as an
eccentric genius.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c012'>It is to be feared that stump speaking,
in its highest and best sense, is becoming
a thing of the past. People no
longer delight to hear the great political
questions of the day discussed in
a sound, sensible manner on the stump,
but seem to have a morbid appetite for
smutty jokes and low buffoonery. The
man who can tell the most anecdotes
is the man for the office. It is a shame
for the citizens of a State to applaud
the vulgar jokes of men running for
high offices. Such men deserve to be
frowned upon with the virtuous indignation
and contempt of every true
citizen. It matters not how well they
may tell their jokes, yet they are corrupters
of the morals of the young
who hear them, and do injury to the
State in which they live, just in proportion
to their talent and influence.
Why is it that we so rarely have discussions
now to which ladies can listen?
Why is it that we do not have canvasses
like that of Prentiss in Mississippi
years ago, when he stumped the State
for Congress, and the ladies turned out
to hear the famous orator? Such stump
speeches as those made by Douglas and
Lincoln in Illinois, and Gov. Wise in
Virginia, in which these great men discussed
the political issues of the country
in a statesman-like way? Why
was President Garfield abused so outrageously
by the stump speakers of
opposite political faith to him, and a
few months afterwards, when he was
assassinated, lauded to the skies by
the same men? Stump speaking in
these latter times seems to have been
assigned, in the main, to the lowest
demagogues in each party, who see
how much mud they can throw at each
other, and how many vile jokes and
political lies they can tell.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c012'>The students of Trinity have in the
past had the reputation throughout the
State of being good speakers. They
should determine to maintain this reputation.
The way to do this is for them
to take an interest in Society work.
Society training is an invaluable part
of every young man’s college education.
No student should fail to improve
the opportunities offered to him
in this line. There is nothing that
should be more congenial to a student
who has any ambition than a good literary
society—a society where he can
learn to express himself with ease and
fluency, with grammatical correctness,
and rhetorical finish, where he can
learn to clothe his thought in appropriate
language, where he can cultivate
his imaginative and reasoning powers.
Some students seem to think that because
they gave not the rhythmic flow
of language of a Cicero, the information
of a Burke, or the wit sarcasm and fluency
of a John Randolph, that it is
useless for them ever to try to become
speakers. They seem to forget that
no man can be a grand success right at
the start, and that persistent effort is
required to succeed at anything. Those
who have no natural talent for speaking
should be encouraged when they
think of Demosthenes and other great
orators, who possessed little natural
powers of oratory. Let every student,
at the beginning of this new year, take
more interest in society work, and
strive to become at least a moderately
good speaker.</p>

from Chaucer to the present
time; with standard selections
from representative writers for critical
study and analysis.</span> By Albert N.
Raub, Ph. D., Principal of the Central State
Normal School, Lock Haven, Pa., and Author
of “Lessons in English,” “Practical
English Grammar,” etc., 468 pp. Cloth.
Philadelphia. Raub &amp; Co. 1887.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is one of the books “to meet a
long-felt want.” The work is intended
not only to give a biographical
sketch of the representative writers,
but also a criticism of their work, and,
following this, a masterpiece selected
from each author’s writings, with such
explanatory notes appended as will
lead the pupil to study more critically
and with more profit not only the
beauties but also the defects, of his
language. It is a book on literature,
criticism, and the literary analysis of
the English classics in one, and is an
admirable supplement to the study of
both Rhetoric and English Grammar.
The plan is the now so popular method
used by Kellogg, Swinton, and others,
thereby giving this book many of the
excellences found in the works of those
scholars. If, however, it be pertinent
to mention among its good qualities a
defect, it may be said that the number
of American authors is out of proportion
to the English, thereby unduly
emphasizing American literature. In
the main, this is a very good book, and
is altogether worthy of the ready acceptance
which it is receiving in quite
a number of our schools and colleges.</p>

“Practical English Grammar,” “Studies in
English and American Literature,” “Methods
of Teaching,” “School Management,”
etc. 320 pp. Cloth. Philadelphia. Raub
&amp; Co. 1887.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the preparation of this work the
author’s aim has been to compile a
treatise on the subject of Rhetoric and
Composition that may claim to be wholly
<i>practical</i> and teachable. The arrangement
of subjects varies from the
usual order, and to good purpose. The
influence of the school to which Bain
belongs is made manifest to a great
and quite beneficial degree, giving the
book characteristics worthy of great
commendation. Each topic or principle
discussed is followed by copious
examples which are in the main fresh
and apposite. “Letter-Writing,” while
well treated, is extended out of proportion
to the rest. A great deal of
space is given in this work to Poetry.
Since the appearance of the works of
Gummere, Mayor, and Schepper, the
attempt to force Latin meter upon the
English accentual verse is unpardonable.
On the whole, however, this is a
very good Elementary Rhetoric.</p>

Everett Hale. Illustrated with fifty
portraits. A. S. Barnes &amp; Co. New York.
1887. 8vo. pp. vi, 603.</p>

<p class='c012'>This work is a series of biographical
essays comprehending fifty of the leading
artists, sculptors, prose writers,
composers, poets and inventors of the
last two hundred years. It treats of
those master spirits who, in contradistinction
to those who belonged to
“schools”, have caused by their individual
efforts material improvements
in their respective spheres. The essays
are written in a perspicuous and
easy style, although the matter is very
condensed. They treat of the subject’s
life as directly influenced by his works,
carry the reader through philosophy,
veiled by incident, and finally drop
him much pleased and wishing there
were more. We may learn a little of
our national inclinations by looking
over the Table of Contents. Among
the artists, sculptors and composers,
not one American is found, showing
that in these features we are deficient.
Among prose writers and poets, America
claims one each. But when we
come to the inventors we find that
four of the nine, classed leading in two
hundred years, were natives of our
one-hundred-year-old republic. An
agreeable feature is the pronunciation
affixed to all proper names, so that we
feel more at ease when we meet in print
our cousins from abroad. The portrait
of each one is given, and dubious points
are explained in ample foot-notes.
The type is large and leaded, and the
volume tastefully bound.</p>

Printer and Binder.</p>

<p class='c012'>Besides following reports of other
States as models, taking from each that
feature which he considers best, the
Commissioner has introduced a chapter
on railroads, a feature by no means
out of place. In chapters III and IV,
the agricultural interests receive their
due share of consideration. The chapter
on Convict Labor, however, shows
a deficiency of information on the general
subject, confines itself to opinions
of politicians, employers of laborers,
and labor organizations, and lacks statistics,
which perhaps time may improve.
For the first effort the report
is a very creditable affair. It is well
indexed, and thus rendered useful to
general readers, all of whom can obtain
it free by writing to the Commissioner
at Raleigh, N. C.</p>

<p class='c012'>The first part of Whitney’s French
Grammar, supplemented by conversational
exercises and lists of idiomatic
phrases, has just been brought out by
Henry Holt &amp; Co. This adds what
was lacking in the other, and affords a
welcome relief from the imperfections
of the conversation-grammars of the
Bôcher-Otto type.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the <cite>Randolph-Macon Monthly</cite>, for
January may be noted the article entitled
“Hanover Court House,” around
which cluster memories of Patrick
Henry; also “De Quincy,” in which the
author gives a graphic criticism of some
of the “English Opium Eater’s” productions.
But the most pleasing feature
of the periodical is a neat cut of
Randolph-Macon’s new gymnasium.
This is a reminder that an article appeared
in this magazine last month
relative to the advantages of a gymnasium.
But it is an established fact
that a weak body and soft muscles will
ever be a serious hindrance to a strong
mind, so too much cannot be said favorable
to that great agent of physical
culture. No College can count itself
fully equipped without this very necessary
feature. In the acquisition of her
“Physical Culture Hall,” Randolph-Macon
may rest assured that she has
taken a long step in the right direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Sophomore and Freshman
years, students use <i>text-books</i>, but in
the Senior and Junior years they use
<i>subjects</i>,—<cite>Haverfordian</cite>.</p>

<p class='c012'>Were ‘should’ inserted in each place
preceding ‘use,’ the above would be true
here. Text-books should blaze the
way, as it were, for the student in the
acquisition of an education. Nothing
is more difficult to instill into the mind
of a student than the principle that he
is to study for an education and not for
a grade. He will not comprehend that,
when school days are over, the world
is not going to look in the “grade-book”
for figures by which to size him
up, but is going to estimate him by
what is in his head. The abolition
of the marking system would be a great
boon to the cause of education. Then
would students leave off worrying and
cramming their heads with the contents
of dry text-books, the knowledge
of which remains only temporarily, and
broaden out with a course of reading,
making the acquisition of knowledge
not a burden but a pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <cite>Wake Forest Student</cite> for January
has a very interesting article on “States
Rights.” It begins by calling attention
to the late decision rendered by the
Supreme Court in the case of Judge
Bond’s injunction. The writer states
in reference to the decision that it has
given to the doctrine of State Rights,
which received almost its death-blow
in the Civil War, “new strength and
new limbs.” It will be remembered
that strength and life began to be infused
in 1872 when the decision was
rendered in reference to the Louisiana
Slaughter house cases; also by the subsequent
decisions “which pronounced
null and void the ‘Kuklux Act’ and
the ‘Civil Rights Act,’ because the
absurd theory on which they were
based would make Congress take the
place of State Legislatures and supersede
them.” Taking into consideration
that the late decision was rendered
by Justices appointed by Republican
Presidents, the principle of State Rights
has indeed received a wonderful impetus.
The author is a very able champion
of the sovereignty of States as the
only sure plan of retaining our individual
rights. We feel sure that his words
voice the sentiment of every true lover
of his State.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the last number of the <cite>College
Message</cite> appears an article of merit
entitled “The Novel Again, A Protest.”
The author is not lacking in
appreciation of novels of the first order,
and, indeed, assigns to works of fiction,
by standard authors, the honor of performing
a great and good office; but
justly criticises that slimy stream of
inferior fiction which is flooding the
marts of literature, and disseminating
vicious and corrupting sentiments in
the minds of the young. The article
shows its author well versed in the
subject. It is acknowledged that cigarettes
and whiskey are the uncompromising
enemy of boys. Inferior
novels are the inveterate enemies of
both boys and girls. The former foes
inflict wounds, for the time being, upon
the body, yet these being vanquished
the wounds will heal; but the latter attack
the mind—the soul—and war with
poisoned weapons whose hurt is incurable.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many of the <span class='sc'>Archive’s</span> political exchanges
are sharply censuring Speaker
Carlisle on account of his treatment of
North Carolina representatives in regard
to the formation of the House Committees.
True, all of them occupy rather
insignificant places. But, upon taking
second thought, fair-minded men will
not accuse Mr. Carlisle of partiality,
but will rather ascribe the placing of
North Carolina members to the short
duration of their membership. North
Carolina has many able sons and delights
to honor them all. To do this,
she distributes Congressional honors
too frequently, so that, when a representative’s
reputation and influence is
just budding, he must step down and
out to make place for a new member.
Thus the State suffers. In regard to
this, North Carolina may well take a
lesson from the North and West.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Raleigh <cite>Chronicle</cite>, one of the
best weeklies in the State, and one
eagerly read by Trinity’s students, lends
a helping-hand to the Endowment
Fund in the shape of a well written,
broad-minded editorial. As long as
the editor wields his pen in behalf of
education, may success attend him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Greensboro <cite>North State</cite>, notwithstanding
its politics, is one of the
most interesting, ably-edited papers
that visit the <span class='sc'>Archive</span>.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c012'>The editor of <cite>The Tobacco Plant</cite>
writes, as the fruit of his visit to Trinity,
an article on the College. In it
he pays a graceful tribute to his instructors
in the days of yore, and
closes with a stirring appeal to North
Carolina Methodists in behalf of Trinity.</p>

on that day from eight to nine o’clock.</p>

<p class='c012'>We learn from some members of the
Faculty that in a few weeks a “Senate”
will be organized at Trinity College.
This is something that all colleges
should have. Who knows but Senate
halls may be filled with Trinity students.</p>

<p class='c012'>Those who remained in Trinity during
the holidays say that it is not by
any means the dullest place in the
world. With the frolics, parties, &amp;c.,
every body seemed to have had a jolly
time.</p>

be completed. This may be
merely a passing notice to some, but
the people of Randolph county have

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
